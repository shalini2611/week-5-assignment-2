    "Inheritance: By inheriting from the Exception class, our custom exception will inherit all the behavior and attributes of the Exception class, including the ability to raise and catch the exception, and the ability to customize the error message.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Catch only the specific exceptions that you are expecting and handle them accordingly. This helps in making your code more robust and maintainable.\n",
    "2. Use the try-except-else-finally block for handling exceptions. The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, the except block handles the exception, the else block executes if no exception is raised, and the finally block executes regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.\n",
    "3. Provide informative error messages that help in diagnosing and fixing the issue. Avoid generic error messages that do not provide any useful information to the user.\n",
    "4. Use logging to record errors and exceptions instead of printing them to the console. This helps in debugging and maintaining the code.\n",
    "5. Use multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions. This allows you to handle different exceptions in different ways, instead of having a single catch-all except block that handles all exceptions in the same way.\n",
    "6. Use context managers like with statements to ensure that resources like files and sockets are properly closed and cleaned up after use, even if an exception is raised.\n",
    "7. Avoid catching and silently ignoring exceptions, as this can lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs later on. Instead, log the exception and/or re-raise it with additional context.\n",
    "8. Do not use exceptions for control flow. Exceptions should only be used to handle exceptional or unexpected conditions, not to control the flow of the program.\n",
    "9. Always clean up after an exception. This includes closing files, freeing resources, and restoring the program state to its previous state."
